# Meeting-Wingman

The perfect wingman to your classroom/professional meetings. Notifies you when you are AFK. Ever fell asleep during a meeting? Or someone knocked at the door? Worry not, we got you covered. 

## Why this project??
Pandemic has been a major setback and given unwanted headaches to students and employees around the world working/studying from home. Sitting in front of computers has increased the screen time exponentially. But worry no more, we are here with our beautiful extension "Meeting Wingman". Our extension helps users deal with the screen time issue by not only generating meeting transcript but also implements various other features. Our Meeting Wingman will notify the user via whatsapp messaging or phone sms, if their name or any particular keyword (like attendance) is called out by the meeting instructor
